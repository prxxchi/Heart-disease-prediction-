❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and other medical attributes. Using supervised machine learning classification algorithms, the model helps in identifying patients at risk and supports early intervention.

The project also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training & evaluation, and visualization of results such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance.

🛠️ Features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, feature scaling).

Implementation of multiple ML models:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest Classifier

Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Visualization of correlations, feature importance, and ROC curves.

Simple prototype for user input → heart disease prediction (Yes/No).
